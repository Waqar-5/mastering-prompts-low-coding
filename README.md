## What is Prompt Engineering? ü§ñ

Prompt engineering is the **skill of crafting inputs (prompts) for AI models** to get the best possible output.  
It‚Äôs **not about memorizing text**, but about **learning how to guide AI** clearly and effectively.

> Example:
> - Weak prompt: `"Write something about dogs."`
> - Strong prompt: `"Write a fun 3-sentence story about a dog who learns to skateboard."`

## Why is it Important? üåü

Modern AI models (like GPT, Claude, Gemini) are powerful but need **clear guidance**:

- Produces **accurate and relevant results**  
- Reduces **vague or incorrect outputs**  
- Enables **specific formats** (tables, bullet points, code)  
- Supports **creative, professional, or technical tasks**

## Components of a Strong Prompt üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Instruction** ‚Äì Tell AI exactly what to do  
   `"Summarize this article in 3 bullet points."`  

2. **Context** ‚Äì Give AI background information  
   `"You are a history teacher. Explain the causes of World War II in simple words."`  

3. **Constraints / Format** ‚Äì Set rules for output  
   `"Write a 4-line poem about spring using rhyming words."`  

4. **Examples (Few-Shot Learning)** ‚Äì Show what correct output looks like  


AI continues: `"Amo programar"`

## Types of Prompting üìö

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Zero-Shot | AI performs task without examples | `"Translate to French: 'Good morning'"` |
| One-Shot | AI given 1 example | `"Translate 'Hello' ‚Üí 'Bonjour'. Now translate 'Good morning'"` |
| Few-Shot | AI given multiple examples | See above example |
| Role-Based | AI acts as an expert | `"You are a career coach. Suggest a resume format."` |
| Chain-of-Thought | AI explains reasoning step by step | `"Solve 23 + 17. Show your steps."` |

## How Prompt Engineering Works üîÑ

1. **Define your goal** ‚Äì What do you want AI to do?  
2. **Craft your prompt** ‚Äì Use instruction, context, examples, constraints.  
3. **Test it** ‚Äì Check AI‚Äôs output.  
4. **Refine it** ‚Äì Adjust wording or examples to improve output.  
5. **Repeat** ‚Äì Iteratively improve until consistent results.

## Advanced Techniques ‚ö°

- **Prompt Chaining** ‚Üí Break large tasks into smaller prompts  
- **Dynamic Prompting** ‚Üí Adjust prompts based on previous AI responses  
- **Template Prompts** ‚Üí Reusable prompt structures  
- **Safety & Bias Controls** ‚Üí Ensure ethical and safe AI output

---

## Real-Life Example ‚úâÔ∏è

**Task:** Write a professional resignation email  

- Weak Prompt: `"Write a resignation email."` ‚Üí Too vague  
- Strong Prompt:  



- Output: Well-structured, professional email ready to use.
