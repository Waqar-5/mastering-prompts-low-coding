# Low-Code Full-Stack Agentic AI Development üöÄ

This repository is part of the **Panaversity Certified Agentic & Robotic AI Engineer** program.  
It provides **learning material for n8n**, low-code full-stack development of AI agents, and certification guidance.

For learning full-code development, refer to the [Learn Agentic AI repository](#).

## Introduction

In this course, we explore how to **build modern AI-powered applications** using a **low-code full-stack approach**.  

Instead of coding everything from scratch, we use specialized tools for each layer:

| Layer | Tool | Purpose |
|-------|------|--------|
| UI/UX | UXPilot | Design professional mockups for app look and feel |
| Frontend | Lovable.dev | Turn designs into functional frontend applications quickly |
| Workflow & AI | n8n | Build AI agents, automate tasks like RAG, file processing, and business logic |
| Backend | Supabase | Manage data storage, authentication, and vector search |
| Integration | MCP (Model Context Protocol) | Connect AI models with tools, databases, and workflows securely |

> **Focus**: We begin with **Prompt & Context Engineering**, the foundation for interacting with AI systems effectively. Mastering this step makes the rest of the stack more powerful and intuitive.

## What is n8n?

n8n (‚Äún-eight-n‚Äù) is an **open-source workflow automation and Agentic AI platform**.  

- Build AI agents and connect APIs, databases, and services using a **visual node-based editor**.  
- Supports **code when needed**, making it ideal for prototyping multi-step AI workflows.  

**Key Advantages**:  
- No-code orchestration with low-code flexibility  
- Ideal for AI agents that **perceive, plan, and act**  
- Ships with AI/LLM nodes (OpenAI, embeddings), tool nodes (HTTP, Slack, DB), and agent patterns

## What are AI Agents?

An AI agent is a system that **perceives, decides, and acts toward a goal**, often over multiple steps and using tools.  

**Difference from chatbots**:  
- Chatbot ‚Üí single-turn Q&A  
- AI Agent ‚Üí multi-step workflow; can access APIs, files, databases, plan next actions, and loop until the goal is met  

**Core Components**:  
1. Planner/Reasoner ‚Üí determines next best action  
2. Tools/Actuators ‚Üí APIs, code functions, external services  
3. Memory/State ‚Üí tracks progress, results, and constraints  
4. Critic/Verifier (optional) ‚Üí validates output and retries if necessary  

**Example Use Cases**:  
- Inbox Triage Agent ‚Üí reads, classifies, drafts replies, schedules meetings  
- Data Analyst Agent ‚Üí pulls DB data, cleans, queries, visualizes, summarizes  
- DevOps Agent ‚Üí monitors logs, triggers incidents, scales services

## No-Code, Low-Code, and Full-Code Platforms

| Dimension | No-Code | Low-Code | Full-Code |
|-----------|---------|----------|----------|
| Primary Users | Business users, analysts | Developers & prototypers | Software engineers |
| Speed to MVP | Fastest | Fast | Slowest |
| UI/Logic | Drag-and-drop | Visual flows + custom code | Fully hand-coded |
| Data | Built-in tables/connectors | Connectors + custom integrations | Any database or stack |
| Extensibility | Limited | Plugins, scripts | Unlimited |
| DevOps/CI/CD | Vendor-managed | Partial | Fully owned |
| Compliance | Varies | Stronger enterprise options | Fully customizable |
| Scale & Performance | Small/medium apps | Medium ‚Üí large | Any scale |
| Cost | Per-user/app fees | Platform + dev time | Infra + engineering |

**When to choose**:  
- **No-Code** ‚Üí Quick CRUD apps, prototypes, or forms  
- **Low-Code (n8n)** ‚Üí Rapid internal tools, workflow automation, prototyping  
- **Full-Code (OpenAI Agents SDK)** ‚Üí Bespoke UX, complex logic, enterprise-grade applications  

**n8n stands as a low-code platform** that allows:  
- 80‚Äì90% of workflows via visual flows  
- Code escape hatches (JS/Python nodes, custom auth)  
- Self-hosting & lower vendor lock-in

## Our Agentic AI Stack

We combine **n8n (low-code)** and **OpenAI Agents SDK (full-code)** for:  

- Fast prototyping ‚Üí validate data models and agent behaviors  
- Production-ready ‚Üí performance, reliability, and compliance  
- Minimal rework ‚Üí same MCP servers can be used in both layers  

**Practical Workflow**:  
1. Prototype in n8n ‚Üí capture human-in-the-loop steps, validate workflows  
2. Codify in OpenAI Agents SDK ‚Üí optimize for performance, security, and scale
